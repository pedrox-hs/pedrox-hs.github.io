Hello! I'm **{{ site.author }}**, a Software Engineer with a passion for technology.

## About Me

I'm originally from Araraquara, located in the interior of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and I've been living in the capital city since 2017. I have an insatiable thirst for knowledge in general. Technology is my world, and I'm constantly exploring new frontiers and discovering innovative ways to solve problems.

## Professional Experience

With over 10 years of experience in software development, my journey began in web development, exploring PHP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and more. In 2015, I ventured into the world of mobile development, starting with Java and later transitioning to Kotlin, the language I currently work with. Furthermore, throughout my career, I've had exposure to a wide range of technologies, including JavaScript, NodeJS, Python, Flutter, Clojure, MongoDB, Docker, Ansible and more.

Recently, I've had the privilege of participating in the production of content for Android development courses and training.

## Commitment to Open Source

I'm a fervent advocate of open-source software and believe that all software should have open source code. The open-source community is a valuable space for collaboration and continuous improvement, and I'm committed to contributing to this movement.

### Technical Skills

My key technical skills include mobile development, problem-solving, CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment), and task automation.

## Other Interests

Beyond technology, I'm fueled by music, love animals, enjoy visiting parks, playing table tennis, and watching scientific videos. I have a special fascination for electronics and electrical work, and I occasionally find myself performing residential electrical tasks.
